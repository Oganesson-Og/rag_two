Educational Assessment Processing Module
----------------------------------------

Comprehensive assessment processing system for evaluating student responses
and providing detailed educational feedback with scoring and recommendations.
Occurs at the end of the lesson. Lesson is a collection of continuous interactions with the user in a
reasonably short amount of time. Say without a break of over 30 minutes. These results need to be stored 
in a database.


TODO: 
    Track student sessions
    Detect session completion
    Generate assessments
    Store performance records
    Maintain clean separation of concerns
    The system is also extensible for future enhancements such as:
    Real-time analytics
    Progress tracking
    Performance reporting
    Learning path recommendations
    Check improvements over time
    Check misconceptions over time

Key Features:
- Response evaluation and scoring
- Criteria-based assessment
- Topic mastery analysis
- Misconception detection
- Strength/weakness identification
- Study recommendations
- Resource suggestions
- Practice exercise generation

Technical Details:
- NLP-based response analysis
- Rubric-based scoring system
- Multi-criteria evaluation
- Educational standards alignment
- Adaptive feedback generation
- Cross-topic understanding assessment
- Performance tracking support

Dependencies:
- spacy>=3.7.2
- numpy>=1.24.0
- scikit-learn>=1.3.0
- tensorflow>=2.14.0
- transformers>=4.35.0
- pandas>=2.1.0

Example Usage:
    # Basic assessment
    processor = AssessmentProcessor(subject='physics', grade_level='high_school')
    result = processor.evaluate_response(student_response)
    
    # Detailed assessment with custom criteria
    result = processor.evaluate_response(
        student_response,
        context={
            'topic': 'quantum_mechanics',
            'difficulty': 'advanced',
            'expected_concepts': ['wave_function', 'uncertainty_principle']
        }
    )
    
    # Batch assessment
    results = processor.evaluate_batch(responses)

Assessment Criteria:
- Content accuracy
- Concept understanding
- Technical precision
- Explanation clarity
- Topic relevance
- Analytical depth
- Problem-solving approach
